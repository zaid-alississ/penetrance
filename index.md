# Penetrance R package

An R package for the estimation of age-specific penetrance for complex
family-based studies in a format compatible with with the Fam3PRO R
package.

## Motivation

Accurate estimation of age-specific penetrance is essential for
assessing disease risk in individuals with pathogenic genetic variants
(PGVs). Penetrance refers to the probability that an individual carrying
a specific genetic variant will develop the associated trait, such as
cancer. Estimating this probability is a crucial step in clinical
decision-making and personalized risk assessment for hereditary (cancer)
syndromes.

The package leverages Mendelian inheritance models, which are widely
used in family-based genetic studies to assess how genetic variants are
passed down through generations. These models typically involve a
proband — an individual for whom family history and genetic data are
collected. The proband serves as the starting point for mapping out the
family’s genetic structure, including relationships and phenotypic
traits, such as cancer diagnoses. Family data, including cancer
occurrence, ages of diagnosis, and genetic test results, are collected
for the proband and their relatives. Using this data, Mendelian models
compute the likelihood of certain genetic configurations and disease
outcomes based on inheritance patterns.

The core methodology in the package relies on a four-parameter Weibull
distribution to model age-specific penetrance. Estimation is performed
using a Bayesian framework with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods,
allowing the package to provide robust and flexible penetrance
estimates. Through this approach, the package models the likelihood of
cancer occurrence across family members, even when some genotypic
information is missing or incomplete, which is common in real-world
studies.

The package also incorporates prior knowledge into the estimation
process, enabling users to specify default, custom, or study-based prior
distributions. By employing the Elston-Stewart peeling algorithm, the
package efficiently calculates likelihoods across family pedigrees,
ensuring scalability and accuracy, even in large datasets.

By providing user-friendly functions for data input, prior
specification, and estimation, the package equips researchers and
clinicians with a powerful tool for estimating cancer risk in complex
family-based studies. This empowers informed decision-making and
preventive strategies in hereditary cancer syndromes, where
understanding the genetic basis of risk is critical for patient care.

## Quick-start guide

This following is a quick-start guide for basic usage of the package.
For greater detail on options, please refer to the other articles.

The primary function in the package is `penetrance`. The package
workflow includes three main parts: user input, including family data in
the form of pedigrees and specification for the penetrance estimation,
the estimation of the posterior distribution using the MCMC approach,
and the outputting of the results in the form of the samples from the
approximated posterior distribution, i.e. the estimated penetrance
function.

``` r

library(penetrance)
```

### Pedigree

The user must specify the `pedigree` argument as a data frame that
contains the family data (see `test_family_1`). The family data must be
in the correct format with the following columns:

- `ID`: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for each
  individual. There should be no duplicated entries.

- `Sex`: A numeric value where `0` indicates female and `1` indicates
  male. Unknown sex needs to be coded as `NA`.

- `MotherID`: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for an
  individual’s mother.

- `FatherID`: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for an
  individual’s father.

- `isProband`: A numeric value where `1` indicates the individual is a
  proband and `0` otherwise.

- `CurAge`: A numeric value indicating the age of censoring (current age
  if the person is alive or age at death if the person is deceased).
  Allowed ages range from `1` to `94`. Unknown ages can be left empty or
  coded as `NA`.

- `isAff`: A numeric value indicating the affection status of cancer,
  with `1` for diagnosed individuals and `0` otherwise. Missing entries
  are not supported.

- `Age`: A numeric value indicating the age of cancer diagnosis, encoded
  as `NA` if the individual was not diagnosed. Allowed ages range from
  `1` to `94`. Unknown ages can be left empty or coded as `NA`.

- `Geno`: A column for germline testing or tumor marker testing results.
  Positive results should be coded as `1`, negative results as `0`, and
  unknown results as `NA` or left empty.

### Model specification

There are a few ways in which a user can specify how the estimation
approach is run. Available options are:

- `pedigree`: A data frame containing the pedigree data in the required
  format. It should include the following columns:
  - `PedigreeID`: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for
    each family. There should be no duplicated entries.
  - `ID`: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for each
    individual. There should be no duplicated entries.
  - `Sex`: A numeric value where `0` indicates female and `1` indicates
    male. Unknown sex needs to be coded as `NA`.
  - `MotherID`: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for
    an individual’s mother.
  - `FatherID`: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for
    an individual’s father.
  - `isProband`: A numeric value where `1` indicates the individual is a
    proband and `0` otherwise.
  - `CurAge`: A numeric value indicating the age of censoring (current
    age if the person is alive or age at death if the person is
    deceased). Allowed ages range from `1` to `94`. Unknown ages can be
    left empty or coded as `NA`.
  - `isAff`: A numeric value indicating the affection status of cancer,
    with `1` for diagnosed individuals and `0` otherwise. Missing
    entries are not supported.
  - `Age`: A numeric value indicating the age of cancer diagnosis,
    encoded as `NA` if the individual was not diagnosed. Allowed ages
    range from `1` to `94`. Unknown ages can be left empty or coded as
    `NA`.
  - `Geno`: A column for germline testing or tumor marker testing
    results. Positive results should be coded as `1`, negative results
    as `0`, and unknown results as `NA` or left empty.

  For example, to indicate that “ora024” and “ora027” are identical
  twins, and “aey063” and “aey064” are identical twins, use the

  be performed when `age_imputation = TRUE`.

### Prior Specification

Penetrance provides the user with a flexible approach to prior
specification, balancing customization with an easy-to-use workflow. In
addition to providing default prior distributions, the package allows
users to customize the priors by including existing penetrance estimates
or prior knowledge. The following settings for the prior distribution
specification are available:

### Additional User Inputs

- The
  [`penetrance()`](https://nicokubi.github.io/penetrance/reference/penetrance.md)
  function takes baseline age-specific probabilities of developing
  cancer as input `baseline_data`. In the default setting with
  `BaselineNC = TRUE` this baseline is assumed to reflect the
  non-carrier penetrance. For rare mutations this is considered a
  reasonable assumption. The baseline_data must be a data frame with
  baseline data for females and males.

- The specification of allele frequency (`allele_freq`) is required. The
  function automatically converts this to carrier prevalence using the
  approximation `carrier_prevalence ≈ 2 * allele_freq` for rare
  autosomal dominant conditions.

- The
  [`penetrance()`](https://nicokubi.github.io/penetrance/reference/penetrance.md)
  function also includes an option for automatic age imputation
  `AgeImputation`. We apply an age imputation as part of the MCMC
  routine. The imputation of ages is performed based on the individual’s
  affected status ($`aff`$), sex ($`sex`$), and their degree of
  relationship to the proband who is a carrier of the PV. For greater
  detail on the age imputation approach see documentation.

- For the likelihood calculation monozygous twins can be specified using
  the `twins` argument.

``` r

twins <- list(c("ora024", "ora027"), c("aey063", "aey064"))
```
