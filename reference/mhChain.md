# Execution of a Single Chain in Metropolis-Hastings for Cancer Risk Estimation

Performs a single chain execution in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
for Bayesian inference, specifically tailored for cancer risk
estimation. This function can handle both sex-specific and
non-sex-specific scenarios.

## Usage

``` r
mhChain(
  seed,
  n_iter,
  burn_in,
  chain_id,
  ncores,
  data,
  twins,
  max_age,
  baseline_data,
  prior_distributions,
  prev,
  median_max,
  BaselineNC,
  var,
  age_imputation,
  imp_interval,
  remove_proband,
  sex_specific
)
```

## Arguments

- seed:

  Integer, the seed for the random number generator to ensure
  reproducibility.

- n_iter:

  Integer, the number of iterations to perform in the
  Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

- burn_in:

  Integer, the number of initial iterations to discard (burn-in period).

- chain_id:

  Integer, the identifier for the chain being executed.

- ncores:

  Integer, the number of cores to use for parallel computation.

- data:

  Data frame, containing family and genetic information used in the
  analysis.

- twins:

  Information on monozygous twins or triplets in the pedigrees.

- max_age:

  Integer, the maximum age considered in the analysis.

- baseline_data:

  Numeric matrix or vector, containing baseline risk estimates for
  different ages and sexes.

- prior_distributions:

  List, containing prior distributions for the parameters being
  estimated.

- prev:

  Numeric, the carrier prevalence (heterozygote frequency) in the
  population. Note: This is automatically calculated from allele
  frequency in the main penetrance() function as approximately 2p for
  rare variants.

- median_max:

  Logical, indicates if the maximum median age should be used for the
  Weibull distribution.

- BaselineNC:

  Logical, indicates if non-carrier penetrance should be based on SEER
  data.

- var:

  Numeric, the variance for the proposal distribution in the
  Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

- age_imputation:

  Logical, indicates if age imputation should be performed.

- imp_interval:

  Integer, the interval at which age imputation should be performed when
  age_imputation = TRUE.

- remove_proband:

  Logical, indicates if the proband should be removed from the analysis.

- sex_specific:

  Logical, indicates if the analysis should differentiate by sex.

## Value

A list containing samples, log likelihoods, log-acceptance ratio, and
rejection rate for each iteration.
