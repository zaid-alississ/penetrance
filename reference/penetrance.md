# penetrance: A Package for Penetrance Estimation

A comprehensive package for penetrance estimation in family-based
studies. This package implements Bayesian methods using
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for estimating age-specific penetrance of
genetic variants. It supports both sex-specific and non-sex-specific
analyses, and provides various visualization tools for examining MCMC
results.

This function implements the Independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
for Bayesian penetrance estimation of cancer risk. It utilizes parallel
computing to run multiple chains and provides various options for
analyzing and visualizing the results.

## Arguments

- pedigree:

  A list of data frames, where each data frame represents a single
  pedigree and contains the following columns:

  - `PedigreeID`: A numeric or character identifier for the
    family/pedigree. Must be consistent for all members of the same
    family within a data frame.

  - `ID`: A unique numeric or character identifier for each individual
    within their respective pedigree data frame.

  - `Sex`: An integer representing biological sex: `0` for female, `1`
    for male. Use `NA` for unknown sex.

  - `MotherID`: The `ID` of the individual's mother. Should correspond
    to an `ID` within the same pedigree data frame or be `NA` if the
    mother is not in the pedigree (founder).

  - `FatherID`: The `ID` of the individual's father. Should correspond
    to an `ID` within the same pedigree data frame or be `NA` if the
    father is not in the pedigree (founder).

  - `isProband`: An integer indicating if the individual is a proband:
    `1` for proband, `0` otherwise.

  - `CurAge`: An integer representing the age of censoring. This is the
    current age if the individual is alive, or the age at death if
    deceased. Must be between `1` and `max_age`. Use `NA` for unknown
    ages (but note this may affect analysis or require imputation).

  - `isAff`: An integer indicating the affection status for the cancer
    of interest: `1` if diagnosed, `0` if unaffected. Use `NA` for
    unknown status.

  - `Age`: An integer representing the age at cancer diagnosis. Should
    be `NA` if `isAff` is `0` or `NA`. Must be between `1` and
    `max_age`, and less than or equal to `CurAge`. Use `NA` for unknown
    diagnosis age (but note this may affect analysis or require
    imputation).

  - `Geno`: An integer representing the germline genetic test result:
    `1` for carrier (positive), `0` for non-carrier (negative). Use `NA`
    for unknown or untested individuals.

- twins:

  A list specifying identical twins or triplets in the family. Each
  element of the list should be a vector containing the `ID`s of the
  identical siblings within a pedigree. For example:
  `list(c("ID1", "ID2"), c("ID3", "ID4", "ID5"))`. Default is `NULL`.

- n_chains:

  Integer, the number of chains for parallel computation. Default is 1.

- n_iter_per_chain:

  Integer, the number of iterations for each chain. Default is 10000.

- ncores:

  Integer, the number of cores for parallel computation. Default is 6.

- max_age:

  Integer, the maximum age considered for analysis. Default is 94.

- baseline_data:

  Data providing the absolute age-specific baseline risk (probability)
  of developing the cancer in the general population (e.g., from SEER
  database). All probability values must be between 0 and 1. IMPORTANT:
  This should be AGE-SPECIFIC risk, NOT cumulative risk. The function
  will warn if the data appears to be cumulative (monotonically
  increasing or sum \> 1). - If `sex_specific = TRUE` (default): A data
  frame with columns 'Male' and 'Female', where each column contains the
  age-specific probabilities for that sex. The number of rows should
  ideally correspond to`max_age`. - If `sex_specific = FALSE`: A numeric
  vector or a single-column data frame containing the age-specific
  probabilities for the combined population. The length (or number of
  rows) should ideally correspond to `max_age`. Default data is provided
  for Colorectal cancer from SEER (up to age 94). If the number of
  rows/length does not match `max_age`, the data will be truncated or
  extended with the last value.

- remove_proband:

  Logical, indicating whether to remove probands from the analysis.
  Default is FALSE.

- age_imputation:

  Logical, indicating whether to perform age imputation. Default is
  FALSE.

- median_max:

  Logical, indicating whether to use the baseline median age or
  `max_age` as an upper bound for the median proposal. Default is TRUE.

- BaselineNC:

  Logical, indicating that the non-carrier penetrance is assumed to be
  the baseline penetrance. Currently only TRUE is supported. Setting
  FALSE will throw an error.

- var:

  Numeric vector, variances for the proposal distribution in the
  Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Default is
  `c(0.1, 0.1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5)`.

- burn_in:

  Numeric, the fraction of results to discard as burn-in (0 to 1).
  Default is 0 (no burn-in).

- thinning_factor:

  Integer, the factor by which to thin the results. Default is 1 (no
  thinning).

- imp_interval:

  Integer, the interval at which age imputation should be performed when
  age_imputation = TRUE.

- distribution_data:

  Data for generating prior distributions.

- allele_freq:

  Numeric, the population allele frequency of the risk variant (p). This
  will be automatically converted to carrier prevalence (approximately
  2p for rare alleles) for internal Bayesian calculations. Default is
  0.0001. Must be between 0 and 1. The function will warn if the value
  seems unusually high (\> 1%), which may indicate confusion with
  carrier prevalence.

- sample_size:

  Optional numeric, sample size for distribution generation.

- ratio:

  Optional numeric, ratio parameter for distribution generation.

- prior_params:

  List, parameters for prior distributions.

- risk_proportion:

  Numeric, proportion of risk for distribution generation.

- summary_stats:

  Logical, indicating whether to include summary statistics in the
  output. Default is TRUE.

- rejection_rates:

  Logical, indicating whether to include rejection rates in the output.
  Default is TRUE.

- density_plots:

  Logical, indicating whether to include density plots in the output.
  Default is TRUE.

- plot_trace:

  Logical, indicating whether to include trace plots in the output.
  Default is TRUE.

- penetrance_plot:

  Logical, indicating whether to include penetrance plots in the output.
  Default is TRUE.

- penetrance_plot_pdf:

  Logical, indicating whether to include PDF plots in the output.
  Default is TRUE.

- plot_loglikelihood:

  Logical, indicating whether to include log-likelihood plots in the
  output. Default is TRUE.

- plot_acf:

  Logical, indicating whether to include autocorrelation function (ACF)
  plots for posterior samples. Default is TRUE.

- probCI:

  Numeric, probability level for credible intervals in penetrance plots.
  Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.95.

- sex_specific:

  Logical, indicating whether to use sex-specific parameters in the
  analysis. Default is TRUE.
